    <p>This data story is created for course "Data Visualization" at KU Leuven. Our goal is to visualize 
    the <strong>changes in human mobility</strong> in 2020. 
    <br>
    <h3> Google Mobility Data </h3>
    
    Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, Google has provided open-source <a href="https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/"> Mobility Reports.</a> From Google: "These Community Mobility
    Reports aim to provide insights into what has changed in response to policies aimed at combating COVID-19. The reports chart movement trends over time by geography, across different categories
    of places such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential."<br> <br>
    
    <strong>The data show how visits and length of stay at different places change compared to a baseline. The baseline is the median value, for the corresponding day of the week, during the 5-week
    period Jan 3–Feb 6, 2020.</strong>
    <br> <br>
    
    <h3> Other Data Sources </h3>
    To add information, we used data on Covid-19 cases from Our World in Data. We also used another dataset on Covid-19 response measures.

    <br>
    Let's get started! 
    <br>
    <br>
        
    <h3>Continent View: Which nation has the highest change in mobility at a point in time?</h3>
    
    Here we will write some information about what data we use, what time period, and what
    the globe shows

    Let's take a look at the continent we're currently on: Europe.

    <h3>Europe: How do Nations Compare Across Time and Mobility Indicator?</h3>
    
    <p> Here we will describe this plot.</p>
    
    <p> Instruction: Select three distinct countries, select a time frame, click "filter"! </p>

    <h3> Let's see how covid cases might play a role </h3>
    <p>x-axis: New cases per million (average over 1 month). <br> y-axis: Net change in mobility (average over
    all indicators, average over 1 month).</p>
    
    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Start by selecting a month. Hover the mouse over the scatterplot. It should look like a + sign.
    Then, drag and select the bubbles of interest. A chart will appear! To remove it, drag and select some
    empty space. To change month, click a button!</p>

    On every calendar heatmap, we notice something unique: a strong change in mobility on December 24 and December 25. The most likely cause? Christmas Day! Let's take a closer look:
